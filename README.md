- 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel! I code for fun and for money! Professionally I build low-code application development platforms, RPA, and process mining systems in Java, Golang and TypeScript. Personally, I love to start projects and never finish 😅
- 👀 I’m interested in the emerging web technologies, the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/), Rust and databases.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang, AWS, and advanced Java. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things that improve the daily lives of developers or things that are just plain cool!
- 📫 How to reach me: Email: danielchirt16@gmail.com
